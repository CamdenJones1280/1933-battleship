Both wrote the program alone and compared when we met up. We each wrote the whole thing apart and then picked the most
streamlined version of what we came up with.

It is all compiled and run using intellij and their integrated interface.

The only assumption we make going through is the person playing the game knows tha basic rules and what each of the
power ups do.

We did not really add anything special that sets this program apart besides denoting when a ship is sunk by an 'S'
being displayed on the board for the player to see.

We are unaware of any more bugs in our code at this time.
